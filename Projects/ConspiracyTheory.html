    <h3>Basics of Recommendation Algorithms</h3>
      <p> Recommendation Algorithms are information filtering systems used to present a use with information that is</p>
      <p> apparently relevant and applicable to the user's interests and needs.</p>
      <p>Usually, this information can come in the form of literal recommendations or advertisements that<p>
      <p>advertise products that a user might be interested in.</p>
      <p>In order to present such information, the algorithm gathers data about the user about various topics</p>
      <p>such as the user's watch time and consumption of certain genres of media, along with the user's</p>
      <p>interactions on social media platforms. There are many forms of reccomendation algorithms;however, most</p>
      <p>fall under these three categories: collaborative filtering, content filtering, and context filtering.</p>
      <p>Collaborative filtering reccomends items to a user based on the reactions and preferences of other users</p>
      <p>who have consumed similar digital media. (INSERT DIAGRAM)</p>
      <p>Content filtering recommends content to a user based
	on the attributes of previous media and items viewed by the user.(INSERT DIAGRAM)</p>
      <p>Context filtering uses the patterns seen in a user's actions to predict the probability of the user's next actions</p>
      <p> in order to generate the appropriate recommendations.</p>
      <p> Many large companies such as Spotify, Netflix, and Instagram use recommendation algorithms in order to increase</p>
      <p>viewer retention and interest on the platform, to generate greater revenue, and to provide a better experience</p>
      <p>for their users.</p>
      <p> Despite the seemingly good intentions of these algorithms, there are some negative side effects.</p>
      <p>The inherent logical and computing nature of these algorithms can lead to inaccurate recommendations</p>
      <p>which may annoy a user. Moreover, the appeal of these algorithms may lead to an overuse, leading to</p>
      <p> too many reccomendations appearing to the user.</p>
      
													
      <h3>The Feedback Loop</h3>
      <p>Feedback Loops are similar to recommendation algorithms in that both utilize the a user's previous interactions</p>
      <p> in order to predict a user's potential interests and appealing forms of content for the user.</p>
      <p> This concept is best shown through the echo chamber effect, also called the filter bubble effect.</p>
      <p>The main idea of the echo chamber effect is that as a user's preferences and opinions become more clear, </p>
      <p>users will often find their opinions or similar views echoed back to them on digital platforms.</p>
      <p>This can result in users becoming tunnel visioned as they are only exposed to media that goes along with their</p>
      <p>own views.With such limited exposure, the echo chamber effect can allow users with misled opinions to become</p>
      <p>only further misled from the truth.This is called confirmation bias.</p>
      <p>With such strong preconceived notions, users can begin to think less critically of outside information due to their </p>
      <p>biased thinking.</p>
      <p>Both recommendation algorithms and feedback loops are very similar in their marketing intentions and process</p>
      <p>Both of these are used as strategies to draw users back to a certain platform, and both form recommendations</p>
      <p>from a users past experiences.</p>
      <h3>Conspiracy Theories and Algorithmic Amplification</h3>
      <p>Conspiracy theories and algorithmic amplications have a strong cause and effect relationship, which creates problems</p>
      <p> for the world. Firstly, conspiracy theories on their own are often found to be misleading in nature and can present </p>
      <p>false information, resulting in further division and arguments between people, both digitally and in the real world.</p>
      <p>This includes conspiracy theories such as the Flat Earth theory, the faked moon landing, and 9/11 being an inside job.</p>
      <p>Despite this, conspiracy theories are still very interesting and seemingly engaging to audiences, which may </p>
      <p>lead to users consuming more media and content relating to conspiracy theories on the Internet and digital platforms.</p>
      <p>Due to the increased consumption of such media, algorithms, such as recommmendation algorithms, may begin presenting</p>
      <p>users with more information relating to the conspiracy theories and may indirectly spread the conspiracy theories.</p>
      <p>Some have argued that with the spread of conspiracy theories containing misleading and harmful information, the social</p>
      <p>media platforms which spread the information are also guilty of misleading audiences.</p>
      <p>This indirectly suggests that social media companies may be prioritizing their own profit, while being well aware</p>
      <p>of the bad information they are spreading.</p>
      
      <h3>Platform Incentives</h3>
      <p>Most digital platforms and major companies have very similar motivations.</p>
      <p>Nearly all of these platforms aim to maximize the amount of user engagement and viewing time on their platform.</p>
      <p>In order to accompilish these goals, these platforms utilized the aforementioned reccomendation algorithms and other</p>
      <p>software programs. As mentioned before, the use of these technologies, along with a platform's incentive, </p>
      <p>can lead to misinformation being spread in order to maximize the platform's success.</p>  
      <h3>Potential for Exploitation</h3>
      <p>With the many benefits that can come with the use of algorithms such as recommendation algorithms, there will </p>
      <p>always be some risk associated with it. The efficiency and power these algorithms hold give the controller of these</p>
      <p>algorithms the ability to create huge changes through digital means. Conspiracy theorists can alter images or data</p>
      <p> and spread it by promoting their content with misleading titles and controversial content. A similar incident occured</p>
      <p>when conspiracy minded individuals supporting the "Pizzagate" conspiracy theory created content supporting their </p>
      <p>conspiracy theory by taking images out of context, editing the images, and spreading the information through platforms</p>
      <p>such as Reddit and 4Chan. </p>
      <p>Content creators on digital platforms can also exploit and game the system in order to make more profit and get </p>
      <p>more benefits. While it is not necessarily as extreme as the previously mentioned example, it can still spread</p>
      <p>misinformation. A clear case of this are Youtubers who have become familiar with the Youtube Algorithm and have</p>
      <p>posted content specifically designed to give them the most profit and attention. This can come at the cost of </p>
      <p>geniune and factual content, since Youtubers may spread misinformation which can give them more views than </p>
      <p>posting the truth.</p>

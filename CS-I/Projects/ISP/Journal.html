<h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
<p>There were no interpersonal challenges this week.</p>
<p>All of the team members were able to work together well.</p>
<p>Moreover, the coordination between the team members is growing more.</p>
<p>If any challenges should occur, the team members knows the rules of social conduct.</p>
<h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
<p>There were no technical challenges this week.</p>
<p>The team has been learning how to render using the software.</p>
<p>Moreover, everyone has gotten more familiar with game programming.</p>
<p>If challenges should arise we can ask the teacher for help or other teams.</p>
<h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
<p>The main scheduling challenge has been to figure out how to get enough time in class to work on the project.</p>
<p>Most of the team mates spend class time working on the computer science assignments.</p>
<p>The way to solve this problem is to ask the teacher for more time in class.</p>
<p>We could also try to get more time outside of class.</p>

<p>For instance, we could consult the teachers or other teams.</p>	
<h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
<p>There were no scheduling challenges this week.</p>
<p>The only main challenge was finding the time to work on the actual project.</p>
<p>Everyone has been busy with computer science assignments leaving no time to work on the project.</p>
<p>The way to solve this problem is to complete the assignments faster or find more time outside of class to work on the project.</p>

<p>For instance, we could ask the teachers for help or ask other teams.</p>
<h3>Scheduling Challenges:</h3>
<p> There have been some scheduling issues.</p>
<p>There has not been enough time to work on the project.</p>
<p>All of the team members have been working on challenges and missions, making it hard to work on the project.</p>

<u><h2>20-Feb-2023</h2></u>
<h3>Interpersonal Challenges:</h3>
<p>There were no interpersonal challenges this week.</p>
<p>During the week, there seemed to be no problems regarding the ISP project.</p>
<p>Moreover, everyone collaborated and helped each other solve issues.</p>
<p>If any problem should arise, the rules set previously seem to work well.</p>
<h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
<p>The team had little technical challenges.</p>
<p>The team had challenges figuring out how the game should be programed.</p>
<p>It was difficult to figure out what processes were necessary to build the game.</p>
<p>However, the problems can be solved by consulting with other teams and with the teacher.</p>
<h3>Scheduling Challenges:</h3>
<p>There were a few scheduling challenges this week.</p>
<p>Firstly, there has not been a lot of classtime or outside time to work on the project together</p>
<p>However, that problem can be solved by collaborating more outside of class whenever possible.</p>
<p>Overall, there were not many challenges this week, and any challenges can be solved through teamwork and collaboration</p>	
	  
<u><h2>13-Feb-2023</h2></u>
<h3>Interpersonal Challenges:</h3>
<p>There were no interpersonal challenges this week as the whole team worked well together.</p>
<p>No one brought up any issues or problems with the project.</p>
<p>Since everyone worked well together, none of the rules had to be changed.</p>
<p>If problems should arise, there are already set rules to handle any issues.</p>
<h3>Scheduling Challenges:</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge has been finding the time to really work on the project.</p>
<p>There was already work for the past weeks and the whole team was busy.</p>
<p>This made it hard to get the entire team together in order to work on the project.</p>
<p>However, the workload has been lessening a little bit, and the teacher may give more time in the future.</p>
<h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
<p>No one in the team has encountered any technical difficulties as of yet.</p>
<p>However, there is not doubt that problems will arise when debugging.</p>
<p>In order to fix those challenges, the team will have to do research and consult with other people</p>
<p>Moreover, the team can also consult with the teachers in tutoring or at another time.</p>	
<u><h2>6-Feb-2023</h2></u>
<h3>Interpersonal Challenges:</h3>	
<p>There were no interpersonal challenges this week.<p>
<p>The entire team worked well together  and there were no arguments.<p>
<p>If arguments should arise, I trust that the team can sort it out.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are already regulations and rules in place for the team's social conduct.</p>
<h3>Scheduling Challenges:</h3>
<p>There were some scheduling challenges for this week.<p>
<p>The snow from last week has caused delays in multiple aspects of the project.</p>
<p>The team will recover from the delays through consulting with other people and teachers.</p>
<p>Overall, there were no other scheduling challenges this week.<p>
<h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
<p>There were no major technical challenges this week.</p>
<p>The only challenge was learning enough about programming to have a good foundation for the game.</p>
<p>It was hard to find the right resources to use in the game.</p>
<p>However, the challenges will be overcome by learning more during class and exapnding.</p>	
<u><h2>30-Jan-2023</h2></u>
<h3>Interpersonal Challenges:</h3>
<p>There were no interpersonal challenges during this week.</p>
<p>Everyone in the team worked well together and collaborated.</p>
<p>The rules of conduct that were set in place previously have been followed.</p>
<p>Overall, the team is prepared should any challenges arise.</p>
<h3>Scheduling Challenges:</h3>
<p>There were no scheduling challenges that occured this week.</p>
<p>The unpredictable weather caused some uncertainties.</p>
<p>School was at risk of being cancelled which led to some setbacks in the schedule.</p>
<p>However, as long as the team keeps together and continues, everything will work out.</p>
<h3>Technical Challeges:</h3>
<p>There were no major technical challenges this week.</p>
<p>Everything went smoothly, however it has been somewhat difficult to research the right coding methods to use.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is somewhat confusing as to what needs to be downloaded and what is not necessary to download.</p>
<p>However, these challenges will be solved when we consult with the teacher or other people.</p>	
<u><h2>23-Jan-2023</h2></u>
<h3>Scheduling Challlenges:</h3>
<p>There were no major scheduling issues this week.</p>
<p>However, it has been hard to find a good time when all of the team members and meet and discuss the project in depth.</p>	
<p>This may have been due because all of the team members were busy with other work in class or outside of class.</p>
<p>However, this issue will be resolved by communicating more actively in the team group chat every week.</p>
<h3>Interpersonal Challenges:</h3>
<p>The team had no interpersonal challenges this week.</p>
<p>For the most part, the whole team worked well together and shared ideas.</p>
<p>If issues should arise in the future there have been set rules in the team google doc.</p>
<p>Additionally, the team has a group chat that can be used to resolve issues.</p>
<h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
<p>There were little technical challenges this week.</p>
<p>When I researched further into the ways to create a game, I found many different ways to do it.</p>
<p>Each method required different kits and sprites that had to be downloaded.</p>
<p>This issue can be solved by deciding what method will work best for the team and by consulting with the teacher.</p>	
<u><h2>17-Jan-2023</h2></u>	
<h3>Interpersonal Challenges:</h3>
<p>The team had no interpersonal challenges this week.</p>
<p>I have created a set of social conduct and rules for the team that could settle potential diasgreements.</p>
<p>The rules may need to be revised in the future when new problems arise, but they will work for now.</p>
<p>I expect that the team will have few issues as all of the team members work well together.</p>
<h3>Scheduling Challenges:</h3>
<p>There were not any scheduling challenges for this week.</p>
<p>After I created a general calendar for the team, no one has brought up any issues they had with it.</p>
<p>Moreover, everyone has agreed with the schedule set, and all the team members have viewed the group google doc.</p>
<p>If scheduling challenges should arise, we may have to redo the schedule in order to compensate for the challenges.</p>
<h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
<p>No specific technical challenges have come up this week.</p>
<p>However, the team had not gotten alot of research done on the project.</p>
<p>Once further research is done, new problems will most likely arise.</p>
<p>The team will solve the challenges by consulting with the teacher and looking for potential solutions on the internet.</p> 	
<u><h2>9-Jan-2023</h2></u>
<h3>Interpersonal challenges:</h3>
<p>There have been no interpersonal challenges this week.</p>
<p>Any dispute that came up last week has already been settled well.</p>
<p>If a argument or dispute should start in the future, the team has begun some planning to deal with those issues.</p>
<p>Additionally, everyone in the team understands their place in the team, so interpersonal challenges will be unlikely.</p>
<h3>Technical Challenges:</h3>
<p>No technical challenges have arised yet, however the team has found some small issues.</p>
<p>For instance, we have to settle on a good browser to use for our project.</p>
<p>We have considered using a browser like Firefox, since it was introduced to us.</p>
<p> This challenge will be overcome once we do more research into the best browser for the project.</p>
<h3>Scheduling Challenges:</h3>
<p>There have been no scheduling challenges this week.</p>
<p>Scheduling has actually been going well as the team has a shared google doc and group chat.</p>
<p> The only challenge has been deciding exactly how much time should be spent in each stage of development.</p>
<p> However, that will be settled once we understand how much time game developing takes in each of its stages.</p>

<u><h2>2-Jan-2023</h2></u>
<h3>Interpersonal challenges:</h3>
<p>There were no interpersonal challenges within the team as of yet, except for a team member's absence.</p>
<p>The team member will be caught up on everything he missed out on.</p>
<p>Everyone is collaborating well and all the team members agree on the project and its execution.</p>
<p>If other disagreements come up, we will have to create a good plan to deal with them.</p>
<h3>Scheduling challenges:</h3>
<p> We have not created a proper schedule for the project as of yet.</p>
<p>That will be settled soon, once we all get together to create a manageable plan.</p>
<p>Additionally, the schedule will have to fit with everyone's daily schedule.</p>
<p>Other than that, there were not any other scheduling issues.</p>
<h3>Technical challenges:</h3>
<p>None of us are knowledgeable on the languages and process we will have to use to create the project.</p>
<p>Additionally, none of us also know what problems we may have to expect and deal with.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we do not know if we will need additional resources to complete the project.</p>
<p>However, once we figure those issues out through research, there will be less technical issues.</p>

<p>software and code.The software development engineer also analyzes and modifies existing software.</p>
<p>The software development engineer designs and formats the software through different programming languages.</p>
<p>I would be suitable for this role because I am fairly knowledgeable in the main programming languages needed.</p>
<p>I expect to have trouble learning the proper syntax for the software and how to solve small problems and bugs.</p>
<p>I will overcome these challenges by asking for assistance from my teammates and researching different solutions online.</p>

<h3>QA Engineer:</h3>
<p>The QA engineer is responsible for the testing and debugging of the program and software.</p>
<p>The QA engineer also creates tests that identify issues in the software before the  product launches.</p>
<p>Additionally, the QA engineer also reports problems to the other team members and collborates to solve the problems.</p>	
<p>I would be somewhat suitable for this role as I am not the best at debugging.</p>
<p>Generally, debugging takes time for me as I cannot identify the problem quickly.</p>
<p>I will overcome these challenges by learning to quickly read over code and find problems in it.</p>

<h3>Project Manager</h3>
<p>The project manager is responsible for overseeing the entire group and creating deadlines and calenders.</p>
<p>The project manager also plans and schedules all required tasks that will need to happen.</p>
<p>Additionally, the project manager is also responsible for closing out the projects and helping to ensure the project's success.</p>	
<p>I would be most suited for this role as I am good at planning out tasks well.</p>
<p>However, managing all the tasks may be a problem as it would be hard to keep up with all the tasks.</p>
<p>I will overcome these challenges by making sure my teammates also understand the required tasks and deadlines.</p>	

<h3>Product Manager</h3>
<p>The product manager is responsible for understanding what the users want and to moniter the market.</p>
<p>Additionally, the product manager is also responsible for prioritizing product features and capabilities</p>
<p>The product manager must work closely with sales and marketing in order to have success.</p>	
<p>I would be somewhat suited for this role because I am not the best at marketing or advertising.</p>
<p>Additionally, I am not that knowledgeable on what users will want and how to better develop the product. </p>
<p>I will overcome these challenges by asking my teammates about what people will want.</p>

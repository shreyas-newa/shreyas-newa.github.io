	<h3>1.1:Why is the test executed prior to the loop?</h3>
	<p>The test is executed prior to the loop so that the program has time to evaluate the condition and appropriately respond with a loop.</p>
	<h3>1.2:Compare this diagram to that of the conditional. What are the similarities? What are the differences?</h3>
	<p>This diagram utilizes a test section and has multiple alternatives according to the input. However, both have at least 2 possible outcomes.</p>
	<h3>1.3:What is the purpose of the Jump instruction after the consequent?</h3>
	<p>The jump instruction is used in order to jump to test the condition at the beginning of the loop.</p>
	<h3>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h3>
	<p>I learned how while loops work and how they relate to conditionals. The big idea is that while loops are interconnected with conditionals and work well with them.</p>
	<h3>What challenges did I encounter?</h3>
	<p>I had some troubles remembering how to distinguish a while loop.</p>
	<h3>How could this experience be improved?</h3>
	<p>This experience could be improved by adding more examples in Swift</p>
	<h3>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h3>
	<p>This article has made my thinking more ordered and logical and has shown me how loops and conditionals work together.</p>

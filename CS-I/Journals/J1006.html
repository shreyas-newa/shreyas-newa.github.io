    <h3>1.1: What is Git communicating to you? </h3>
    <p>Who added comments or changed the file and when they did it. </p>
    <h3>1.2: What do you see that is common between this git log command and the previous git commit?</h3>
    <p>Both commands say that there was a commit made to the file.<p>
      <h3>1.3: Why do you think this is?</h3>
    <p>When I executed the git commit command, it showed that a commit was made, and when I executed the git log command, it showed all of the commits in the repositoryâ€™s history. The git log command addressed the changes made by the git commit command.<p>
      
    
    <h3>2.1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?</h3>
    <p>File2.txt was labeled as untracked because it has not been staged and added to the repository. File1.txt was not labeled as untracked, but it did have some changes that had not been staged for commit </p>
    <h3>2.2: Are they both displayed in the same section? If not, why not?</h3>
    <p>No, they are not displayed in the same section because File1.txt only had some changes that needed to be staged for commit, while File2.txt had not been tracked yet. </p>

     
    <h3>3.1: What do you notice about file1.txt and file2.txt? How are they displayed in git status?</h3>
    <p>The files have both been staged, and have changes to be committed.
    </p>
    <h3>3.2: Compare and contrast the manner in which the two files are displayed.</h3>
    <p>Both files have both been staged, and have changes to be committed. However, file1.txt is marked as modified, while file2.txt is marked as a new file.</p>
    
    
    <h3>4.1: How many files are listed as having been changed?</h3>
    <p>2 files are listed as having been changed. </p>
    <h3>4.2: What are the specific differences listed for each file? In what color is the difference displayed?</h3>
    <p>File1.txt lists the change I made which said, "This is a new line", while File2.txt lists the change I made which said, "This is a new line in a new file." Both lines of text are displayed in a green color.
    </p>

 
    <h3>5.1: What does Git tell you has changed? Why?</h3>
    <p>After I executed the git diff --cached command, Git did not tell me anything, because all changes had already been committed. </p>

    
    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned about commits and how source control works. The "big idea" is that source control plays an important role in tracking and managing code. </p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when I had a little trouble understanding the concepts at first, but I figured it out. </p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by making it  more interactive and easy to follow.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p> This has made my thinking more open and critical. It has also helped my brain understand past concepts better.</p>

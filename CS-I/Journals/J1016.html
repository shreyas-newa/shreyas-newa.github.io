<h1>Input, Output, and an Inverter:</h1>
<h2>Click on the leftmost (input) H in the top diagram which simply represents a wire.</h2>
<h3>What happens to the H?</h3>
<p>H becomes L when I toggle the input.</p>
<h3>Does the color of the wire change?</h3>
<p>Yes, the wire becomes gray.</p>
<h3>How is the output impacted?</h3>
<p>The output becomes low voltage instead of high voltage.</p>

<h2>Click on the leftmost (input) H in the bottom diagram which represents an inverter.</h2>
<h3>What happens to the H?</h3>
<p>The H becomes an L.</p>
<h3>Does the color of the wire change?</h3>
<p>Yes, the front half of the wire becomes green.</p>
<h3>How is the output impacted?</h3>
<p>The output becomes high voltage instead of low voltage.</p>

<h1>AND Gate</h1>
<h2>Click on the top L input.</h2>
 <h3> What happens to the top L?
 <p>The top L becomes an H.</p>
 <h3> What happens to the output?
  <p>The output remains as L.</p>
  <h2>Click on the bottom L input.</h2>
 <h3> What happens to the bottom L?</h3>
 <p> The bottom H becomes an L.</p>
 <h3> What happens to the output?</h3>
 <p> When both inputs are activated, the output becomes high voltage.</p>

 <br>
 <br>
<h3> What did I learn? What is the "big idea"? </h3>
 <p> I learned that and, or, xor and other gates play an important role in circuits and can change the output</p>

 <h3> What challenges did I encounter? </h3>
 <p>I had trouble using the circuit page at the beginning, but I eventually got used to it</p>

 <h3> How could this experience be improved? </h3>
   <p>This experience could be improved by giving more detailed instructions on how the circuit page worked.</p>

  <h3>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking? </h3>
 <p> I have become more accustomed to think in a computer's mindset, which made the excersizes easier.</p>

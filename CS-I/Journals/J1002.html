    <h3>1.1: Name at least two other services that you personally use which are implemented using a Client/Server Model</h3>
    <p>Two other services that I personally use which are implemented using a Client/Server Model are Youtube and Gmail. </p>

    
    <h3>2.1: It appears that both Jack Williams and John Williams can have a directory of the same name. Do you think the ability to have two different users create a directory of the same name is important? Why?</h3>
    <p>It is important because if two different users have to create a directory of the same name, but don't have the ability to do that, it would interfere with their work. It could also ruin computer related projects that require two different users to have the same directory name. </p>

    
    <h3>3.1: Why do you think the home directory has a special symbol to represent it?</h3>
    <p>The home directory has a special symbol to represent it so that users can clearly identify that they are in the home directory. This allows for easy navigation between directories. </p>


    
    <h3>4.1: Did the prompt change? If so, how? Why is this useful? </h3>
    <p>The prompt did change by adding a tilde, followed by a slash and “Merlin”. This is useful because it indicates that we are in the directory called "Merlin". </p>


     
    <h3 >5.1: What happens each time you press the up arrow key?</h3>
    <p>When I press the up arrow, it scrolls through previous commands that I have done in the shell. </p>
    <h3>5.2: What happens each time you press the down arrow key?</h3>
    <p>When I press the down arrow, it goes from one command that I typed, to the command I typed after it. </p>

 
    <h3>6.1: Was "Hello, World!" printed to the screen as before? If not, why not? What do you think happened to the text?</h3>
    <p>"Hello, World!" was not printed to the screen as before because the echo command send the text reading, “Hello, World!”, to the out.txt file. </p>


     
    <h3>7.1: How does the ls command differ from the tree command?</h3>
    <p>The ls command lists files in the current directory, while the tree command shows the directory paths, and files in each directory. </p>
    <h3>7.2: How do you choose to use one over the other?</h3>
    <p>The ls command is better used when the user only wants to see the files in one directory, while the tree command is better when the user wants to see all the directory paths and files. </p>

     
    <h3>8.1: What do you think the argument to sleep specifies?</h3>
    <p>I think the argument to sleep specifies how long the command should “sleep” for in seconds. </p>
    <h3>8.22: Are you able to prove your hypothesis? How?</h3>
    <p>Yes, I am able to prove my hypothesis. When I typed in the “sleep 5” command, I counted that the command slept for 5 seconds. </p>

    
    <h3>9.1:How is the behavior different from what you expected? </h3>
    <p>The behavior is different because I can still type commands even though the command should be sleeping. </p>
    <h3>9.2: What do you think it means to run a job in the background?</h3>
    <p>I think it means that the job is still running, but still allows the user to do other jobs at the same time, so that the user won't have too many jobs running at the same time in the foreground. This means that the program no longer depends on input from the user. </p>
    <h3>9.3: What do you think the number displayed in brackets specifies?</h3>
    <p>I think it specifies the order in which the user typed the commands.</p>
      
     
     <h3>10.1: What do you observe as you execute the jobs command?</h3>
    <p>I observe that each time I enter a new job, it is added to the list of previous jobs I created. </p>
    <h3>10.2: How do you explain your observations?</h3>
    <p>When I typed "jobs", the program listed all of the jobs I had running, meaning that it was keeping track of the jobs which are still running.</p>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned that the different commands that can be performed in the shell. The "big idea" is that there are different commands with different functions that can be used together to perform more complicated tasks.</p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p> I had a little bit of trouble memorizing the commands and getting used to using them regularly.</p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by making it more interactive.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that the information I have learned have made my thinking more systematic and it has made me a quicker thinker, since I have to recall the appropriate commands at different times.</p>

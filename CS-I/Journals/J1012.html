    <h3>1.1: Describe the general process for executing addition, regardless of base.</h3>
    <p>First, the numbers must be vertically aligned, then addition is executed by moving through the columns and carrying whenever needed.</p>

    
    <h3>2.1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with octal numbers?</h3>
    <p>Factors like the fact that the number line only goes up to eight, and that there is no 9 need to be considered when executing addition with octal numbers.</p>
    
    <h3>3.1:  What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with hexadecimal numbers?</h3>
    <p>Factors like the fact that numbers greater than 10 are replaced with letters need to be considered when executing addition with hexadecimal numbers.</p>

    <h3>4.1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with binary numbers?</h3>
    <p>Factors like the fact that there are only two numbers available need to be considered when executing addition with binary numbers.</p>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned that addition is different depending on the number system. The “big idea” is that addition is important in any number system, and is used in different situations.
    </p>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I encountered challlenges when I had trouble understanding how the addition worked in different number systems. </p>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by including more videos and explanations.</p>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I now realize that I need to think more mathematically in some situations in order to solve problems.</p>

	<h3>1.1.1: Throw 100 darts (N = 100). What result do you obtain?</h3>
	<p>The result obtained was 3.28.</p>
	<h3>1.1.2: Throw 1000 darts (N = 1000). What result do you obtain?</h3>
	<p>The result obtained was 3.08.</p>
	<h3>1.2: How is the second result different from your previous result?</h3>
	<p>The second result was more accurate than the first result.</p>
	<h3>How large should N be to accurately estimate Ï€ to five digits?</h3>
	<p>N should be in the millions or even the billions to accurately estimate pi to five digits.</p>
	<h3>How important is it that the dart be "thrown" randomly?</h3>
	<p>It is important that the dart is thrown randomly in order to ensure that a variety of points are hit, thereby giving a more accurate estimate.</p>

	<h3>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h3>
	<p>I learned how useful randomness and trignometric functions can be applied in programming. The big idea is that random numbers can be very useful in certain situations.</p>
	<h3>What challenges did I encounter?</h3>
	<p>I had trouble at first understanding how the concepts connected together, but I eventually understood it.</p>
	<h3>How could this experience be improved?</h3>
	<p>This experience could be improved by adding more information and examples how the information applies in real life scenarios.</p>
	<h3>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h3>
	<p>The information I have learned has led me to change my method of thinking in certain situations and learn to see problems from different angles. I now see that programming can involve math and even relates to math.</p>

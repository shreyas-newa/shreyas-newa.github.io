	<h3>1.1:Compare this behavior to that of the while loop. What are the similarities? What are the differences?</h3>
	<p>The repeat-while loop executes the statements within the body of the loop first while the while loop does not. However, both tests two conditions and create a loop accordingly.</p>
	<h3>1.2:What are the minimum number of times that this loop will execute?</h3>
        <p>The minimum number of times is 1 time.</p>
	<h3>1.3:What is the purpose of the Jump instruction after the consequent?</h3>
	<p>The purpose of the jump instruction after the consequent is to jump to statements at beginning of loop.</p>
	<h3>2.1:Are you able to implement the same functionality found in a while loop using a repeat-while loop, without changing the condition or adding a conditional? Explain and provide an example.</h3>
	<p>Yes, as long as the initial value of a variable used in the condition is true. In this case both while loop and repeat-while loop will execute the block of code the same number of times. But if the initial value of a variable used in the condition is such that the condition is false, the repeat-while loop will still execute the block of code at least once, while the while loop will not execute the block of code at all. In the below example, if the initial value of variable x=3 (meaning the condition is false), then while loop and repeat-while loop will give different result. But if the initial value of variable x=6 (meaning the condition is true), both while loop and repeat-while loop will give same result.</p>
	<p>Example:</p>
	<b><p>REPEAT-WHILE LOOP:</p></b>
	<center><p>var x = 3</p> </center>
	<center><p>repeat  {</p></center>
	<center><p>print("consequent")</p></center>
	 <center><p>x -= 1</p></center>
	 <center><p>print(x)</p></center>
	 <center><p>} while (x > 4)</p></center>
	   <center><p>print("alternative")</p></center>
	 <center><u><p>Output:</p></u></center>
	 <center><p>consequent</p></center>
	 <center><p>2</p></center>
	 <center><p>alternative</p></center>

	 <center><b><p>WHILE LOOP:</b></p></center>
 <center><p>var x = 3</p></center>
 <center><p>while (x > 4)  {</p></center>
 <center><p>print("consequent")</p></center>
 <center><p>x -= 1</p></center>
 <center><p>print(x)</p></center>
 <center><p>}</p></center>
 <center><p>print("alternative")</p></center>
 <center><p>Output:</p></center>
 <center><p>alternative</p></center>
<p> As you can see in the example, the repeat while loop cannot execute the same functionality as the normal while loop, since it will print a statement at first no matter the condition.</p>
<h3>2.2:Are you able to implement the same functionality found in a repeat-while loop using a while loop, without changing the condition or adding a conditional? Explain and provide an example.</h3>
<p>Only if the initial value of a variable used in the condition is true. In this case both repeat-while loop and while loop will execute the block of code the same number of times. But if the initial value of a variable used in the condition is such that the condition is false, the repeat-while loop will still execute the block of code at least once, while the while loop will not execute the block of code at all.</p>
<p>As seen in the above example for 2.1, the while loop will not print a statement before checking the condition.</p>
<h3>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h3>
<p>I learned how repeat while loops work. The big idea is that repeat while loops have slightly different functionality than normal while loops.</p>
<h3>What challenges did I encounter?</h3>
<p>I had trouble at first understanding how repeat while loops differ from normal while loops.</p>
<h3>How could this experience be improved?</h3>
<p>This experience could be improved by adding more examples in Swift.</p>
<h3>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h3>
<p>This has shown me how repeat while loops can work better in certain situations and has made me more logical. It has also allowed me to better understand normal while loops.</p>

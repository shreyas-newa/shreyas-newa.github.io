	<h3>1.1: How does branching enable significantly more complex program behavior?</h3>
	<p>Branching enables changes to be made while still maintaining the stability of the program.</p>
	<p>Additionally, it enables the computer to execute different parts of the program without having to follow a sequential order.</p>
	<p>Through this, the computer can do more complex program behavior.</p>
	<h3>1.2: Why do you think the term consequent is used to refer to the statements that are executed when the Boolean test evaluates to true?</h3>
	<p>I think the term consequent is used since the statements of the program are a consequence of the Boolean tests and depend on the Boolean test's evaluation.</p>
	<h3>2.1: Why is the first Jump instruction conditional? What determines whether the jump will be executed or not?</h3>
	<p>The first Jump instruction is conditional because it needs to check if the certain conditions are met in order to be executed by the program.</p>
	<p>Flags determine whether the jump will be executed or not as well as whether the jump is conditional or unconditional.</p>
	<h3>2.2: What is the purpose of the Jump instruction after the consequent?</h3>
	<p>The purpose of the Jump instruction after the consequent is to skip the alternative.</p>
	<h3>2.3: Why is there no need for a corresponding Jump instruction after the alternative?</h3>
	<p>There is no need for a corresponding jump instruction after the alternative because there are no more conditions to evaluate for the program.</p>
	<p>There is also no further execution that has to be done.</p>
	
	<h3>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h3>
	<p>I learned how flowcharts and conditionals can make coding easier.The big idea is that flowcharts and conditionals are essential in writing programs.</p>
	<h3>What challenges did I encounter?</h3>
	<p>I had no big challenges for this article.</p>
	<h3>How could this experience be improved?</h3>
	<p>This experience could be improved by adding more examples.</p>
	<h3>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h3>
	<p>My learning has shown me how crucial flowcharts are related to coding and has improved upon my logical thinking.</p>

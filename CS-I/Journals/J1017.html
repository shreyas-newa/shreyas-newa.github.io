	<h3>1.1: What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Carry column?</h3>
	<p>The AND truth table produces the output of the Carry column.</p>

	<h3>1.2:What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Sum column?</h3>
	<p>The XOR truth table produces the output of the Sum column.</p>

	<h3>2.1: What do you notice about the relationship between the first-half (top four rows) of the full-adder as compared to all of the rows of the half-adder?</h3>
	<p>Both use the same inputs and outputs.</p>

	<h3>2.2: Why is this true?</h3>
	<p>This is true because both tables utilize the same inputs, which will both lead to the same result.</p>

	<h3>3.1: Why does the least significant bit position use a half-adder rather than a full-adder?</h3>
	<p>It uses a half-adder because a full adder can only be used with two single-bit binary integers plus a carry.</p>

	<h3>3.2: Assume that proper inputs are applied for all bits in numbers A and B. Will the correct output from S be available instantaneously? If not, why not?</h3>
	<p>Yes, because since all the proper inputs were applied, then the output should be available instantaneously.</p>

	<h3>3.3: Assume that we have a standard (non-scientific calculator) capable of adding two 16-bit words. Two numbers, A and B, are added together. After the addition, it is noted that C15 is high. What can we infer? What is this state commonly called?</h3>
	     <p>We can infer that the calculator used a ripple carry adder, which allowed it to produce the high output. This state is called cascading adders.</p>
	     <h3>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h3>
	     <p>I learned that adders play a crucial role in calculating numbers. The "big idea" is that adders are used in order to calculate numbers of various bits.</p>
	     <h3>What challenges did I encounter?</h3>
	     <p>I had trouble understanding the difference between the full and half adder, but i eventually understood it.</p>
	     <h3>How could this experience be improved?</h3>
	     <p>This experience could be improved by including more explantations</p>
	     <h3>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h3>
	     <p>This has led me to understand more how computers think and made me realize the sequential mode of thinking used by computers.</p>

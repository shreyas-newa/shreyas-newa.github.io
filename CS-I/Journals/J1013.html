	  <h3>1.1:Why is one of the symbols used for exclusive disjunction the “not equal to” sign?</h3>
	 <p> One of the symbols is the “not equal to” sign because in exclusive disjunction, only one output can be true, but both outputs can not be true at the same time. Therefore, A cannot be equal to B, hence the “not equal to” sign.</p>
	  
	<h3> 2.1:Why is the formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table related only to the number of inputs, and why is the formula 2 to the power of n(number of inputs)?</h3>
	 <p> The formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table is related only to the number of inputs since each input can have a max of two outputs, which are true and false. Therefore, it is unnecessary to have anything more in the formula.The formula is 2 to the power of n since one input can have two different outputs at any given time.</p>

	<h3> What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h3>
	<p> I learned that there are different trains of thought and logic. The "big idea" is that different forms of logic can result in different outputs. </p>

	<h3> What challenges did I encounter?</h3>
	<p>I encountered challlenges when I had trouble learning how truth tables and different forms of logic worked.</p>

	<h3> How could this experience be improved?</h3>
	<p> This experience could be improved by including more examples, explanations and practice problems with answers.</p>

	<h3> Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h3>
	 <p> I now realize that I have learned forms of logic and the basis of logic works. I have become more of a logical thinker, which pairs well with mathematical thinking. </p>
